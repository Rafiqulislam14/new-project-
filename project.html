    <h1 id="style">Summer Vacation</h1>
    <p class="size" >In Bangladesh, summer vacation for schools and colleges is typically scheduled between April and June, after the final exams. However, in 2024, the summer vacation was shortened by one week. The original plan was for it to end on July 2nd, but it was shortened to June 25th, with classes resuming on June 26th. This was done to recover learning losses due to the heatwave and other factors affecting classroom activities.</p>
